# Etch-a-Sketch

## Project Overview

This project is a browser version of Sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## Motivation

This is another project for "The Odin Project" where I can use what I've learned so far.

## Progress

Completed the canvas with the ability to change the number of pixels up to 100 pixels. I did the challenge of randomizing the hover color.
I am currently working on adding the ability to either draw using randomized color, or a selected color.


## Learnings

- How to use @import in CSS to import fonts.
- How to do a hover effect using 'mouseover'.
- Randomize RGB colors.
